I work as a software developer. Most of my day job involves writing C++ and Python code.
When I get some free time, I try to hack Haskell, Common Lisp, Javascript among others.

You can find more information about me from my [LinkedIn](https://in.linkedin.com/in/sumannandan) and [GitHub](http://github.com/snandan/) accounts.

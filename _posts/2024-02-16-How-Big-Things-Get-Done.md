- These are the notes that I have collected while reading the book: How Big Things are Done. Written by Bent Flyvbjerg and Dan Gardner

- ### TL;DR
	- Ever wonder how big projects like building townships, commissioning factories or laying highways are planned? How are budget, time etc. for these projects are forecasted? Is there any science behind that? The authors have not only explored that in this book but also suggested proposals for improving that.  They have also given interesting anecdotes regarding how the Sydney Opera House, Guggenheim Museum at Bilbao and Heathrow Airport Terminal 5 were planned and build.
- ### Think Slow, Act Fast:
	- Planning is important. Spend more time to plan the project. Once the planning is done, start acting to finish each milestone of the project as soon as possible. If possible, divide milestones into inch-stones. The less time the execution of the project is in flight, the lesser would be the probability of it getting derailed.
- ### The Commitment Fallacy:
	- Don't get prematurely locked in into a plan without due considerations. However this is common and sometimes done deliberately like when one wants to win a contract or get a project approved. In that case superficial planning is handy because it glosses over major challenges, which keeps the estimated cost and time down, which wins contract and gets projects approved.
	- This can also be due to psychology (optimism bias) or politics, where starting a project would ensure power grab (strategic misrepresentation).
	- Hofstadter's Law: It always takes longer than you expect, even when you take into account Hofstadter's Law.
	- Bias for action can get translated to bias against thinking.
	- [Suck cost Fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost)
- ### Think from Right to Left
	- Projects routinely starts with answers, not questions. Start with the question - what does the project supposed to solve. Projects are not goal in themselves - they are the means by which a goal can be achieved.
- ### Pixar Planning
	- Create a rough draft plan and continue to tinker that, till it becomes perfect. Iteration is common when creating software systems.
	- Try to use software models as much as possible when planning for a product.
- ### Are you experienced
	- Hire people who have prior experience delivering similar projects.
	- The Olympics is one event which are forever planned and delivered by beginners. They change venue (preferably continents) every 4 years. So the officials responsible are all new for every edition of the event. This is one major reason budget forecast for Olympics overshoot all the time.

- ### So you think your project is unique?
	- remove uniqueness bias from project planning.
	- People use a process called _"anchoring and adjustment"_ to forecast any estimate. In case the forecaster do not have any prior experience, the anchoring process can be completely arbitrary - based on some prior bias. It is easy to fall for a bad anchor. This can cause forecasts to be totally wrong.
		- In a psychology experiment done by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, they asked test subjects to spin a 'wheel of fortune' - numbered 1 to 100. After that, they asked the test subjects a completely unrelated question - like 'How many countries in Africa are part of UN?'. If the test subjects did not have any prior knowledge about that fact, the estimate they gave was anchored around the number they got in the wheel of fortune spin.
		- 'limit 6 per customers' in grocery stores acts more as an anchor - then an actual limit.
	- In any non trivial project, there are always many small probabilities that some things might go wrong. Those small probabilities when added together equal to a large probability that something real bad can happen. During forecast, if we ignore all those small probabilities, then the forecast becomes unrealistic.
	- **Reference Class Forecasting (RFC)**: Instead of treating a project to be unique, view that as one in a class of similar projects already done, as "one of these". Use all relevant data from those projects like cost, time, benefits etc. and use that as an anchor. If there is something specific in the current project, then adjust the forecast up or down.
	- This way, we remove uniqueness bias and take into account any 'unknown unknowns' which can derail a project - provided we take sample size which is large enough.
	- They work because they are experience-based, real-world outcomes, not estimates, so they are not distorted by psychology and strategic misrepresentation.
	- Even data from just one completed project are valuabe. (Instead of calling that reference _class_, you can call that reference _point_).
- ### Can Ignorance be your friend?
	- Does serendipity help in big projects? Almost never does, but there are certain examples where it had worked.
- ### A single, determined organism
	- Once a planning and forecasting is done, it is time to act fast and deliver.
	- The success of any project depends on getting the right team.
	- How to create a great team
		- Get them an identity associated with the project. How proud should they feel on successful completion of the project.
		- Get them the ability to freely speak their mind. They should have "psychological safety".
	- Why certain types of projects have propensity to go disastrously wrong - like: **nuclear power plants, hydroelectric dams, information technology, tunnels, major buildings, aerospace** and many more.
	- On the other hand, certain types are projects are always easy to estimate and they rarely goes wrong - like: **solar power, wind power, fossil thermal power, electricity transmission and roads**.
- ### What's your lego
	- There are two kinds of projects. One, where we deliver _one huge_ thing - like a nuclear power plant. The second one, where we deliver _many small_ things - like wind farms, consisting of many wind mills
	- It is easier to forecast and deliver projects which are _many small_ things. It is easy to build something which is small and simple. We are basically repeating the same thing over and over. Besides that, repetition generates experience, which helps to understand any flaws in the process and fix them. Construction of Empire State Building is one example where every floor is almost exactly same. It took little over a year  from start to opening of the building.
	- In every project, try to find the 'Lego' - the small piece which can be replicated to deliver the complete project. Sometimes the project can itself be modified from being _one huge_ thing to repetition of _many small_ things - like how Elon Musk planned Tesla Gigafactory 1 in Nevada. The Gigafactory is composed of 21 small factories which started producing outputs as soon as they were ready - while the other small factories were getting built.
- **The impending climate crisis is one reason why we should radically improve how we plan and deliver big projects.** To achieve "net zero by 2050" would need huge amount of electrification throughout the globe mostly using renewable energy - 11 fold increase in wind energy and 20 fold increase in solar energy. International Energy Agency says, **Every Month**, 10 heavy industrial plant for carbon capture and 3 hydrogen-based industrial plant and 2 gigawatt electrolyzer capacity must be added at industrial sites from 2030 onward - **Every Month!**.
- This kind of scale has never been seen in human history - this is probably the greatest challenge humankind has ever faced. We cannot afford to not deliver these big projects if we were to win the climate battle.

- ### Eleven Heuristics for better project leadership
	- Hire someone who has prior experience of delivering similar projects.
	- Hire the right team
	- Ask the real motivation behind the project
	- Modularize the tasks
	- Spend adequate time planning
	- Remove any uniqueness bias when planning and forecasting
	- Find out as many risks as possible which can derail the project
	- Focus on essentials and use tried and tested technologies.
	- Understand the need of the stakeholders and keep them updated
	- Keep climate change in mind when planning for project
	- Make sure that you are not the reason for the failure of the project - keep your commitment till the project is delivered.

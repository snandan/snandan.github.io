Blockchain today is what Television was in 1930s or Internet in 1990s. For most of us it is a mystery. Some of us who knows, have no idea how this thing works. Very few have the technical know-how to grasp this fully.
However, as you don't need to know how CRT or Plasma physics works to watch television or know about HTTP protocol to use the Internet, it is optional to know all about Blockchain to use it in daily lives.

The concept of Blockchain started when an unknown person under the pseudonym of **Satoshi Nakamoto** (we still don't know who that person is) uploaded a paper in [internet](http://itcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) suggesting an alternative form of money which does not have any physical form (like paper notes or metal coins) and which is not governed by any authority (banks). This was around the time when [Lehman Brothers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lehman_Brothers) got bankrupt. People started to feel if any central authority can be trusted with their money. If those banks goes corrupt or falters, then that thing can have very big impact.

Anyway the question is - how does alternative form of money exist without any physical form? To answer that question we first need to understand what is money? Money is something which promises you to get what you want, in exchange of it. This can only happen if a large number of people puts their trust on that entity which we call money. Most of the time those are made of paper or metal as coins.

Now consider for a moment, that we start treating some **sequence of bits**, stored somewhere in our hard drive, as money. We can give that sequence of bits (electronically) to the local grocery store and get a bottle of detergent liquid.

There are two things to think about. When using physical money, you have to hand that over when buying something. You cannot use it again - because it is no longer with you. However when using bits in the hard drive, what stops you from making a copy of it - so that you can use it again, next time you want to buy something?
On the other hand you may say - 

_'Hello! I already do something like this. See I don't carry paper money. I used to carry cards, now I just tap my phone on merchant's terminal to pay for my things'. Isn't some bits getting transferred from my phone to the shop owners? How is that things any different from bitcoin/blockchain you are preaching about?_

Well - it is very different. 
To start with, those important bits were not there in your phone to start with. They were in some Bank's server. And the Bank make sure that you cannot spend them again.

If we need to get rid of those banks, and still make sure that you do not 'double spend' - we need some sort of magic - right?
Exactly that sort of magic is this piece of technology which we call blockchain. 

There can be various applications of blockchain technology. bitcoin - or this alternative form of currency is just one of them. 

Coming back to how the magic works, lets consider that we have a text file where the names of everyone in the world and how much money they have is listed.

If I want to buy something, I pay by editing that file. Subtract the price from the amount of money I have and add that to the merchant's amount.
The file cannot be tampered without making any valid transaction. And the file is almost impossible to hack. Oh! and one more thing. There is no single copy of that file. Everyone in the world have exactly same copy of the file. If any change is made, the change is synced to everyone's copy.
This is actually too simplistic, almost utopic description of how bitcoin works.

There are lot of things to take care of. Like privacy. Instead of actual names, we have a sequence of alphabets and digits, which uniquely identifies a person.
To know how this thing actually works and how it is 'almost non hackable' - one needs to be a cryptography Ninja. 
We will take baby steps in that direction and would hopefully know how it all works. 

Let's stop today by saying that blockchain is a revolution which is going to change a lot of things in our lives in the coming years. There are already a lot of companies, big and small, who have started investing in this technology. It is not far when we would take this technology as ubiquitous start taking it for granted - the way we do for Television and Internet.

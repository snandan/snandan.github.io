Stack Exchange is conducting a machine learning contest to come up with a classifier which can predict if a post is going to be deleted and why, even before the post is showed up in their site.

There are some cash prizes for this as well. The last date is 9th October 2012. You can get full details in the <a title="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2012/08/stack-exchange-machine-learning-contest/" href="http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2012/08/stack-exchange-machine-learning-contest/" target="_blank">contest site</a>.

I am thinking of participating in this to sharpen my saw, if not to win. Wish me luck !

Recently I learned a new trick to search and replace a particular word across multiple files in a directory using dired-mode. As a programmer I need to do this kind of changes very often in the source code. Before learning this, the best I could do was search the word in cscope, go to each file and do 'M-x query-replace' on those files.

Here are the steps:
<h1>1. Open the directory in Emacs using dired-mode</h1>

I am interested in changing a variable called '_myCount' to '_mCount' across all the files where it occurs.
<h1>2. Select all the files where the word occurs</h1>
I can select ('mark' in dired-mode's terminology) all the files in the directory using 'dired-mark-files-containing-regexp' commands. It is generally bound to 'Shift-% g' key combination.

I need to insert '_myCount' there. It will mark the files containing the word. In my example the files marked in RED below contains the word.

<a href="http://allocthoughts.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/2.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-61" title="marked files" src="http://allocthoughts.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/2.png" alt="marked files" width="584" height="496" /></a>If someone is using a version control which requires the files to be identified before editing them (as in perforce - 'p4 edit') - that can be done by the 'Shift-!' command which takes as an input the shell command to be run on the marked files.
<h1>3. Query replace in marked files:</h1>
Next I need to use the dired-mode command 'Q'.

<a href="http://allocthoughts.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/3.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-62" title="3" src="http://allocthoughts.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/3.png" alt="" width="584" height="496" /></a>This will ask for the word to replace and the new word. Upon entering those, it will start cycling through the marked files containing the word.

<a href="http://allocthoughts.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/4.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-63" title="4" src="http://allocthoughts.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/4.png" alt="" width="584" height="299" /></a>
<h1>4. Confirm the changes:</h1>
At this point I can update each occurrence of the word by selecting 'y' or can update all the occurrences of the current file by selecting '!'.

Once done I can check the updates done.

<a href="http://allocthoughts.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/5.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-64" title="5" src="http://allocthoughts.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/5.png" alt="" width="584" height="299" /></a>
As you can see this is pretty neat. The only problem is this works only in one directory. If that same replacement has to be done in some file sitting in some other directory, the process has to be repeated there.

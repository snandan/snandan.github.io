<h2>Introduction</h2>
I am not an Entrepeneur of any sort and I am definitely not an <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_adopter" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_adopter" target="_blank">early adopter</a> when it comes to  technology. I sincerely feel that there should be some category beyond Laggards so that I  could place myself. Call it 'pathetic depressive clinically laggard'  or something that sort.

I am a computer programmer by profession and to quite an extent by  choice. So I need to keep up with some information which other people generally would not - e.g. What are the different new  features which came in C++ language in the latest revision. That I  think is 'call of duty not' something ingraind in me.

I still use a mobile phone which has just the basic features like  call and SMS. The camera in it takes photograph with such a low resolution that it is impossible to tell whether that is a  human face or a horse. No wonder I don't use its camera. My only excuse all along had been that I don't need anything other  that call and SMS in my phone. Though I had an account for years I avoided Facebook for a long time  believing that it is a of waste of my time.  Little did I know that world has gone a long way in all these years  riding on things like Facebook and Smart phones.
<h2>First step for Entrepreneurship - looking for problems</h2>
As it is mentioned countless times before and recently asserted by Paul Graham in <a title="http://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html" href="http://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html" target="_blank">his article </a> that the way to get startup  ideas is to look for problems. Being an early adopter helps a big time spotting problems when a new  technology wave is coming in. For a laggard that means that he has  to look for problems which all the early adopters have overlooked.

There are people who starts a wave by themselves - they are the innovaters. They give a solution and unless you start using it, you did not know that the problem existed. <a title="http://dropbox.com" href="http://dropbox.com" target="_blank">Dropbox</a> is an example which worked for me that  way. Before it I used to sync my different computers using email or  flash drives and I used to think that, that is the best way possible.
<h2>Adoption not everything - execution is</h2>
Yes, there had been Myspace before Facebook, but Facebook executed beautifully and  today I don't know anyone in my circle who uses Myspace actively. So it is very much possible that people who come a little late in the technology wave and execute better to make a mark.

Having said that early adopters definitely have an edge. They are the people who can most likely transition to a technology entrepreneurship role. Who can forget that <a title="http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/" href="http://david.heinemeierhansson.com/" target="_blank">DHH</a> used a language <a title="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/" href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/" target="_blank">Ruby</a>, which was quite unheard of by many people in the Web domain at that time. That is a classic case of early adoption. The rest, as everyone knows, is history.
<h2>Well..</h2>
A few days back I saw this wristwatch in a shop. It is supposed to work in the deepest point of Pacific Ocean or something like that and it costs a fortune. Not that I am a deep sea diver kind of person - at most I  venture to a swimming pool - what about trying to be an 'early adopter' and buy the watch. Who knows, someday I would work in a ocean floor and I need to check if it is time for dinner. The watch could come handy.
